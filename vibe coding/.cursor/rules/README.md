## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Choose Appropriate Templates

Select templates based on your project's technology stack and requirements:

```bash
# For a full-stack web application
- development.mdc (universal practices)
- backend.mdc (API and server-side code)
- frontend.mdc (UI and client-side code)
- ci.mdc (deployment and automation)

# For an AI/ML project
- development.mdc (general practices)
- finetune.mdc (model training and deployment)
- ci.mdc (ML pipeline automation)

# For a blockchain project
- development.mdc (general practices)
- Solidity.mdc (smart contract development)
- audit.mdc (security and compliance)
- ci.mdc (deployment automation)

# For MCP development
- development.mdc (general practices)
- mcp.mdc (MCP-specific practices)
- ci.mdc (deployment and automation)
```

### 2. Configure Template Application

Templates are automatically applied based on file patterns defined in the `globs` section. Each template includes:

- **File pattern matching** - Automatically applies to relevant files
- **Always apply** - Ensures consistent enforcement across all matching files
- **Comprehensive coverage** - Covers all aspects of development lifecycle

### 3. Customize for Your Project

While templates are comprehensive, you can customize them for specific project needs:

```yaml
# Example customization in template header
---
description: Custom Backend Development Practices for Our Project
globs:
  - "**/*.js"
  - "**/*.ts"
  - "**/api/**"
  - "**/server/**"
alwaysApply: true
---
```

## üìö Template Structure

Each template follows a consistent structure with the following sections:

### 1. **Implementation Techniques**
- Core development practices and coding standards
- Language-specific best practices
- Architecture and design patterns

### 2. **Security & Best Practices**
- Security implementation guidelines
- Vulnerability prevention
- Secure coding practices

### 3. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
- Testing strategies and methodologies
- Quality gates and validation
- Continuous testing practices

### 4. **Performance & Optimization**
- Performance best practices
- Optimization techniques
- Monitoring and profiling

### 5. **Deployment & Operations**
- Deployment strategies

alwaysApply: true
---
```
