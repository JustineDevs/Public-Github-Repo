## 1. Analysis & Planning
- Define the problem statement clearly.
- Identify key objectives and success criteria.
- Outline project scope and constraints.
- Determine data sources, tools, and technologies required.
- Develop a high-level roadmap and timeline.
- Identify stakeholders and communication plan.
## 2. Components Research Phase
- Investigate relevant algorithms, models, and frameworks.
- Evaluate existing libraries and APIs.
- Research domain-specific requirements and best practices.
- Analyze potential technical challenges and risks.
- Document findings and justify component selections.
## 3. Implementation code Phase
- Set up development environment and dependencies.
- Write modular, reusable, and testable code.
- Implement core functionalities first, then auxiliary features.
- Integrate error handling and logging.
- Continuously test and validate each component.
- Maintain clear and consistent documentation within the code.
## 4. Apply themes
- Ensure modularity for ease of updates and scaling.
- Apply security best practices (e.g., input validation, auth).
- Focus on maintainability and extensibility.
- Enhance usability and user experience where applicable.
- Follow ethical AI guidelines including fairness and transparency.
## Design Principles
- Single Responsibility Principle for each module.
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) for clarity.
- DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) to reduce redundancy.
- Scalability to handle growing data or users.
- Robustness to recover from errors gracefully.
## Code Quality Standards
- Use consistent naming conventions.
- Follow language-specific style guides and linters.
- Include comments and docstrings for complex logic.
- Write unit and integration tests with good coverage.
- Perform code reviews and incorporate feedback.
- Use version control (e.g., Git) with meaningful commits.
## Integration Guidelines
- Define clear API contracts and data formats.
- Ensure backward compatibility where possible.
- Validate inputs and outputs rigorously.
- Establish communication protocols (e.g., REST, gRPC).
- Use middleware to handle cross-cutting concerns (e.g., auth, logging).
- Document integration points for other developers.
## Performance Optimization
- Profile code to identify bottlenecks.
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms.
- Cache expensive computations when appropriate.
- Employ asynchronous processing where beneficial.
- Minimize memory footprint and network calls.
- Continuously monitor and tune in production.
## Output format 
- Define output data structure (JSON, XML, CSV, etc.).
- Ensure outputs contain necessary metadata and timestamps.
- Format data for human-readability where needed.
- Include error messages with clear codes and descriptions.
- Provide standardized logs for auditing and troubleshooting.
## Rules
- Adhere to data privacy laws and regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
- Maintain ethical standards in AI model usage and data handling.
- Enforce security policies on data access and storage.
- Limit external dependencies to trusted sources.
- Ensure reproducibility of results across environments.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
