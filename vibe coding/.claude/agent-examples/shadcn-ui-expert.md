Here is an AI-Expert Format template focused on the "shadcn-ui-expert.md" codebase, designed for an AI agent to build subagents specializing in advanced UI component expertise within the Shadcn UI framework. It includes a real example with explanations and a helpful URL link for accurate information gathering.

# AI Expert Template for shadcn-ui-expert.md (UI Expertise)

This template guides an AI agent to analyze, research, and implement advanced UI components following Shadcn UI best practicesâ€”focusing on accessibility, state management, design tokens, and composability. The agent is instructed to parse the UI expert file and generate specialized code and documentation for reusable UI elements.

***

## 1. Analysis & Planning

Initialize the UI expert subagent targeting "shadcn-ui-expert.md" with a clear scope to improve UI states, accessibility, and design consistency:

```python
ui_expert_codebase = "shadcn-ui-expert.md"

def create_ui_expert_subagent(file_name):
    return {
        "target_file": file_name,
        "focus_areas": [],
        "code_samples": [],
        "best_practices": [],
    }

ui_expert_agent = create_ui_expert_subagent(ui_expert_codebase)
```

The agent plans to focus on isolated UI components, managing complex states, and promoting accessibility using ARIA roles and proper markup.

***

## 2. Components Research Phase

The UI expert subagent researches critical UI component concepts:

```python
ui_expert_agent["focus_areas"] = [
    "Advanced React State Management (useReducer, Zustand)",
    "ARIA Attributes for Accessibility",
    "Design Tokens for Theming",
    "Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components",
    "Compound Components Pattern"
]
```

## 3. Implementation code Phase

Example of a controlled toggle switch component implementing accessibility and state handling:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

export function ToggleSwitch() {
  const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState(false);

  return (
    <button
      role="switch"
      aria-checked={enabled}
      onClick={() => setEnabled(!enabled)}
      className={`w-12 h-6 rounded-full transition-colors ${
        enabled ? "bg-blue-600" : "bg-gray-400"
      }`}
    >
      <span
        className={`inline-block w-6 h-6 bg-white rounded-full shadow transform transition-transform ${
          enabled ? "translate-x-6" : "translate-x-0"
        }`}
      />
    </button>
  );
}
```

This snippet shows how to implement accessible UI controls with clear state transitions following Shadcn styling conventions.

***

## 4. Apply themes

- Accessibility: Use ARIA roles and properties appropriately.
- Reusability: Design components as controlled or uncontrolled.
- Theming: Use design tokens for colors, spacing, and typography.
- Composability: Implement compound components for flexible UI patterns.
- Maintainability: Document expected props and state changes.

***

## Design Principles

- Clear separation of concerns between UI and state logic.
- Use declarative patterns for predictable UI behavior.
- Ensure semantic HTML and accessible keyboard navigation.
- Follow design consistency with reusable tokens.
- Simplify API surfaces for component consumers.

***

## Code Quality Standards

- TypeScript integration for prop typing.
- Clear code comments explaining key decisions.
- Unit and accessibility testing (e.g., jest, axe-core).
- Enforce linting rules matching styling guidelines.
- Consistent use of hooks and state patterns.

***

## Integration Guidelines

- API contracts for component props and events.
- Easy integration with form libraries (React Hook Form).
- Support controlled/uncontrolled behavior.
- Document theming options and customization points.

***

## Performance Optimization

- Memoize components where appropriate.
- Minimize re-renders by managing state granularly.
- Lazy load larger UI modules if needed.
- Avoid unnecessary style recalculations.

***

## Output format

The UI expert subagent outputs:

- Markdown reports on UI best practices and state management.
- React component source files with accessibility annotations.
- Theming token JSON or CSS variables definitions.
- Sample usage scenarios and tests.

***

## Rules

- Adhere to WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards.
- Use ARIA roles and properties correctly.
- Avoid inline styles except for dynamic class toggling.
- Maintain composable and extensible component APIs.
- Validate all props for correct types and required fields.
- Provide clear error boundaries for UI failures.
