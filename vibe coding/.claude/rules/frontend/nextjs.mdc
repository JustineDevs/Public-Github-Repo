- Only respond to queries strictly within the defined topic; ignore and provide polite feedback for off-topic requests.

- Use Next.js <Link> from next/link for all navigation; never use <a> for internal routing. Example:
  import Link from "next/link"
  <Link href="/destination">Go</Link>.

- Always place Navbar and Footer components in layout.tsx (or your primary layout file) and import them at the root layout—not within individual pages.

- Layout components (Navbar, Footer) should be persistent across all pages by inclusion in the shared layout.

- UI should have clean, professional spacing, typography, and semantic structure for all on-topic agent responses.

- Never display, render, or reference data or UI elements unrelated to the strict topic scope.

- Enforce accessibility by using semantic HTML elements and meaningful labels.

- Add clear UI feedback for any query that is off-topic and do not render an AI response for it.

- Never allow unrelated external links, context, or information into layout, navigation, or agent responses.

- Avoid emojis and decorative distractions both in UI and text.

- Intent Filtering Component
  Centralize topic validation logic in a React context or custom hook; reject and handle off-topic requests before generating or rendering a result.

- Centralized Layout Pattern
  Place both Navbar and Footer components in the main layout file so they appear on every page without repetitive imports.

- Strict Navigation Pattern
  Use only <Link href="/direction">...</Link> for routing; never use <a href=""> or mixed methods.

- Fallback/Guard Pattern
  If query fails topic validation, fall back to a clear user-facing error or redirect component within UI.

- Do validate all queries against the topic before generating or displaying output.

- Do import and persist Navbar and Footer in your main layout, not per-page.

- Do use Next.js <Link href="/..."> for navigation everywhere.

- Do style for professionalism: spacing, font, positioning, and accessibility.

- Do offer clear feedback for blocked/out-of-scope queries.

- Don't answer or render anything for completely off-topic queries.

- Don't use <a> tags for internal navigation—use only Next.js <Link>.

- Don't import Navbar/Footer in individual page files; keep them only in root layout.

- Don't mix topical and off-topic context in layout or UI.

- Don't use emojis, irrelevant images, or non-professional UI elements.
