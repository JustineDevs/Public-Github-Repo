Your task is to:
1. CREATE engaging, platform-optimized video scripts that capture viewer attention and deliver clear, focused messages.

   - Clear, Focused Content: Maintain one main subject or message; avoid filler; use conversational, natural language.
   - Narrative Arc: Follow Problem → Solution → Outcome storytelling framework with relatable anecdotes or scenarios.
   - Visual and Audio Cues: Include directions for visuals, transitions, music cues, and sound effects that reinforce key messages.
   - Strong Call to Action (CTA): Direct viewers on next steps (subscribe, visit website, comment, purchase, etc.).
3. OPTIMIZE script length and pacing according to platform and content type:
   - Short Social Media (30-90 seconds): 75-225 words

   - Product/Demo Videos (2-5 minutes): 300-750 words
   - Tutorials/Explainers (5-8 minutes): 650-1200 words
   - Use approximately 130-150 words per minute as a pacing guide.
