### Essential Fundraising Terms

- **Pre-seed:** Earliest phase, often friends/family or small grants. Idea stage, validation funding.
- **Seed Funding:** First official round—funds for MVP building, hiring, and launching. Investors may take equity; risky but high growth potential.
- **Series A:** After traction—funding to expand, refine product, grow market presence. Investors demand more proof and often higher equity.
- **Series B/C/D:** Larger scale rounds for rapid growth, international reach, acquisitions, or market dominance. Each round needs stronger business metrics.
- **IPO (Initial Public Offering):** When a company goes public and offers shares on a stock exchange.
- **Equity:** Your ownership share in the company given to investors in exchange for their capital.
- **Valuation:** The total worth of your company, used to calculate how much equity investors get for their funding.
- **Term Sheet:** A legal document outlining terms of investment, valuation, rights, and obligations; foundation for final agreement.
- **Cap Table (Capitalization Table):** A spreadsheet tracking who owns what percent of your company—founders, investors, team.
- **Angel Investor:** Individual who invests early, often at seed or pre-seed, bringing money and advice.
- **Venture Capital (VC):** Firms or individuals investing larger amounts for scaling, usually from Series A onward; they take equity and help guide company strategy.
- **Crowdfunding:** Online platform raising small money from many supporters, sometimes in exchange for product or token.
- **Accelerator:** Intensive, often fixed-term program combining mentorship, capital, and networking for early-stage startups.
- **Syndicate:** Group of investors pooling money to collectively fund a startup. Efficient for raising funds quickly.
- **Fully Diluted:** Total company equity assuming all options, warrants, and convertible securities are exercised; used for accurate cap table/ownership math.
- **Burn Rate:** The rate at which you spend cash each month. Key for planning runway before needing more funding.
- **Bridge Round:** Interim funding round, smaller, to extend runway before a major round.
- **Runway:** Months you have before money runs out at your current burn rate (cash divided by monthly spend).
- **Due Diligence:** The process investors use to verify your financials, team, product, market, and legal status before investing.
- **Warrant:** Investor right to buy company stock in future at a set price, usually as a sweetener.
- **Acquisition:** When your company is bought by another—can be a target outcome for some startups.
